## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Narrow-scope preferences with persistence and reset
The editor SHALL provide a Preferences panel and a persisted preferences file covering: theme (and custom theme selection), focus mode, typewriter mode, code-line-numbers, sidebar visibility, sidebar tab, Heading menu depth (H1–H5 default, optional H1–H6), source-editor font size, rendered-document font size, rendered paragraph spacing, image insertion policies, resource-directory template, and external image-uploader connection/command settings. The preferences file SHALL be TOML (`config.toml` in the Markion config directory) with every field optional and defaulted, and SHALL additionally carry an `[auto_save]` section (`enabled`, `delay_secs`) that is configurable only via the file, not the panel. On startup, if `config.toml` does not exist but a legacy `preferences.conf` (the retired `key=value` format) does, the editor SHALL migrate it to `config.toml` once and thereafter ignore the legacy file. The editor SHALL also offer a preference reset action and a preferences summary in the Help menu. Font family, code-highlight theme, and extension-syntax toggles are **not** configurable under this narrow-scope requirement. Cloud-provider credentials SHALL remain configured in the external uploader; Markion SHALL store only the image handling and external-tool configuration defined by the image capabilities.

#### Scenario: Supported preferences persist and restore
- **WHEN** the user changes a supported preference (theme, focus mode, typewriter mode, code line numbers, sidebar visibility, sidebar tab, Heading menu depth, source-editor font size, rendered-document font size, rendered paragraph spacing, or image settings)
- **THEN** the change is written to `config.toml` and restored on the next launch

#### Scenario: Legacy preferences file is migrated once
- **WHEN** the editor starts with no `config.toml` but a legacy `preferences.conf` present
- **THEN** the legacy values are loaded, written out as `config.toml`, and used; subsequent launches read only `config.toml`

#### Scenario: Partial or missing config falls back to defaults
- **WHEN** `config.toml` is missing, or present but omits fields
- **THEN** missing values take their documented defaults and the editor starts normally

#### Scenario: Preferences summary and reset
- **WHEN** the user opens the Help → preferences summary or triggers the reset action
- **THEN** a summary including supported typography and image settings is shown, or all preferences including typography and image settings are reset to their defaults
- **AND** reset does not modify external uploader configuration, cloud objects, or document resources
