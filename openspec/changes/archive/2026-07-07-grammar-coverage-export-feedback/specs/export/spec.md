## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Multi-format document export
The export engine SHALL export the document to Markdown, styled HTML, plain HTML, LaTeX, DOCX, PDF, and basic PNG/JPEG text snapshots, prompting the user for an output path and suggesting a filename based on the current document. For PDF and DOCX, the editor SHALL first attempt the absorbed Typune export engine (pandoc subprocess, with the PDF engine taken from the `[export] pdf_engine` config value, default `xelatex`); if the external tool is unavailable or the conversion fails, it SHALL silently fall back to the built-in simple implementations so export always succeeds without external dependencies. The status bar message for a successful PDF/DOCX export SHALL disclose which backend produced the file — the pandoc engine, or the built-in writer together with a hint that installing pandoc yields richer output. Export failures SHALL be reported with user-facing status messages.

#### Scenario: Engine-produced export is disclosed
- **WHEN** the user exports to PDF or DOCX and the pandoc engine succeeds
- **THEN** the status message names the output path and indicates the pandoc engine produced it

#### Scenario: Built-in fallback is disclosed with a hint
- **WHEN** the user exports to PDF or DOCX and the editor falls back to the built-in writer
- **THEN** the status message names the output path, indicates the built-in writer was used, and hints that installing pandoc improves output quality

#### Scenario: PDF engine is configurable via the config file
- **WHEN** `[export] pdf_engine` is set in `config.toml` (e.g. `"pdfroff"`, `"tectonic"`)
- **THEN** the pandoc invocation for PDF export uses that engine instead of the default `xelatex`

#### Scenario: Full-fidelity text exports
- **WHEN** the user exports to styled HTML, plain HTML, LaTeX, or DOCX
- **THEN** the export preserves headings, lists, tables (with parsed alignment for LaTeX/HTML), code blocks, math fallback, and footnote/highlight/superscript constructs as each format allows

#### Scenario: PDF and DOCX fallback without pandoc
- **WHEN** the user exports to PDF or DOCX and the pandoc engine path fails (tool missing or conversion error)
- **THEN** the editor silently falls back to the built-in implementation and the export still succeeds

#### Scenario: Basic image snapshot export
- **WHEN** the user exports to PNG or JPEG
- **THEN** a basic text snapshot of the document is produced

#### Scenario: Output path is chosen by the user
- **WHEN** the user triggers an export
- **THEN** the editor prompts for a save location and suggests a filename derived from the current document

#### Scenario: Export failures are reported
- **WHEN** an export step fails
- **THEN** the editor shows a user-facing status message describing the failure
