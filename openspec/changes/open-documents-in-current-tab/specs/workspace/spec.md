## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: File tree panel with filename filtering
The editor SHALL provide a toggleable file tree panel whose workspace root can be established either by explicitly choosing File → Open Folder or, when opening supported content outside the current workspace, from that content's parent directory. The panel SHALL display Markdown files (`.md`/`.markdown`/`.mdown`), a curated set of plain-text files (`.txt`, `.text`, `.log`, `.csv`, `.tsv`, `.org`, `.rst`, `.adoc`, `.asciidoc`), and supported image files (`.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.gif`, `.webp`, `.bmp`, `.tif`, `.tiff`, `.svg`) nested under their containing folders. It SHALL list folders that exist on disk even when they contain no supported files, open Markdown and plain-text files on click as UTF-8 text, open supported image files on click as read-only images, mark the current file, support filename filtering, and support basic create / rename / delete / refresh operations for files and folders. Tab placement for click-opened files SHALL follow the application-wide default open-target preference (see the Multi-document tab model); Ctrl/Cmd+click on a tree row SHALL always open a new tab. Directories on a hard-coded ignore list (version-control, build-output, dependency/cache, and IDE directories) and hidden directories (whose name begins with `.`) SHALL NOT be listed. Other unsupported files (binaries, source code, and unsupported image formats) SHALL NOT appear in the tree. An explicitly selected workspace root SHALL be preserved while contained files are opened. The panel SHALL NOT scan the working directory on startup while only the in-memory welcome document is open; instead it SHALL show an empty-state placeholder until a file or folder is opened. Moving entries via the UI is **not** supported.

#### Scenario: Workspace scan displays supported files
- **WHEN** a workspace root is established via File → Open Folder, the File → Open dialog, the sidebar, or Save As
- **THEN** the file tree scans the applicable root on a background executor, displays Markdown, curated plain-text, and supported image files nested under the folders that contain them, lists folders that exist on disk even when empty, and renders a bounded number of rows per frame
- **AND** unsupported files and ignored or hidden directories are not listed

#### Scenario: Plain-text file opens from the tree
- **WHEN** the user clicks a curated plain-text file (e.g. `.txt`, `.log`, `.csv`) in the file tree
- **THEN** the file opens in the editor as UTF-8 text in the tab chosen by the default open-target rule — replacing the current tab when that is allowed under the preference, otherwise appending a new tab — or focuses an existing tab for the same path
- **AND** the file is rendered through the existing preview pipeline

#### Scenario: Image file opens from the tree
- **WHEN** the user clicks a supported image file in the file tree
- **THEN** the file opens in a read-only image tab in the tab chosen by the default open-target rule, or focuses an existing tab for the same path
- **AND** its bytes are not interpreted as UTF-8 document text

#### Scenario: Modifier-click opens in a new tab
- **WHEN** the user Ctrl/Cmd+clicks a supported file in the file tree
- **THEN** the file opens in a new appended tab regardless of the open-in-current-tab preference and of the active tab's state

#### Scenario: Empty folders are shown
- **WHEN** a non-ignored, non-hidden directory exists on disk but contains no supported Markdown, plain-text, or image files
- **THEN** the directory is still listed in the file tree as a nesting row

#### Scenario: Empty state on startup
- **WHEN** the editor launches with the in-memory welcome document and no file or folder is open
- **THEN** the file tree does not scan the working directory and shows an empty-state placeholder instead of the directory hierarchy

#### Scenario: Open folder establishes the workspace and reveals Files
- **WHEN** the user chooses File → Open Folder and selects one directory
- **THEN** that directory becomes the file-tree workspace root without replacing or modifying the active content
- **AND** the left sidebar becomes visible on the Files tab
- **AND** the selected directory is scanned asynchronously, including when it contains no supported files

#### Scenario: Folder selection cancellation preserves state
- **WHEN** the user cancels the Open Folder picker
- **THEN** the current workspace root, file tree, sidebar selection, active content, and every document's dirty state and undo history remain unchanged
- **AND** the editor reports localized cancellation feedback

#### Scenario: Folder scan failure is non-destructive
- **WHEN** the selected directory cannot be scanned
- **THEN** the editor reports a localized failure status
- **AND** the active content and every document's dirty state, undo history, and derived Markdown caches remain unchanged

#### Scenario: Contained files preserve the selected root
- **WHEN** a supported document or image inside the current workspace root is opened or focused
- **THEN** the current workspace root remains unchanged and the file is marked in the tree

#### Scenario: External file rebases the workspace
- **WHEN** supported content outside the current workspace root is opened through an existing interactive file-opening flow
- **THEN** the workspace root changes to that file's parent directory and the file tree rescans it

#### Scenario: Open, filter, and current-file marking
- **WHEN** the user clicks a supported document or image, types in the filename filter, or switches tabs
- **THEN** the file opens in its appropriate content surface, the tree filters by filename, and the current file is marked in the tree

#### Scenario: Create, rename, delete, refresh
- **WHEN** the user creates a file or folder, renames or deletes an entry, or refreshes the tree
- **THEN** the workspace reflects the change and the tree updates accordingly
