# export

## Purpose

Covers the multi-format export engine and YAML front matter metadata handling. The exports range from full-fidelity (HTML, DOCX, LaTeX) to deliberately limited (a simple single-page text PDF and basic text-snapshot PNG/JPEG). Rich image export fidelity is **not** part of this capability — it is a future candidate.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Multi-format document export
The export engine SHALL export the document to Markdown, styled HTML, plain HTML, LaTeX, DOCX, PDF, and basic PNG/JPEG text snapshots, prompting the user for an output path and suggesting a filename based on the current document. For PDF and DOCX, the editor SHALL first attempt the absorbed Typune export engine (pandoc subprocess, with the PDF engine taken from the `[export] pdf_engine` config value, default `xelatex`); if the external tool is unavailable or the conversion fails, it SHALL silently fall back to the built-in simple implementations so export always succeeds without external dependencies. The status bar message for a successful PDF/DOCX export SHALL disclose which backend produced the file — the pandoc engine, or the built-in writer together with a hint that installing pandoc yields richer output. Export failures SHALL be reported with user-facing status messages.

#### Scenario: Engine-produced export is disclosed
- **WHEN** the user exports to PDF or DOCX and the pandoc engine succeeds
- **THEN** the status message names the output path and indicates the pandoc engine produced it

#### Scenario: Built-in fallback is disclosed with a hint
- **WHEN** the user exports to PDF or DOCX and the editor falls back to the built-in writer
- **THEN** the status message names the output path, indicates the built-in writer was used, and hints that installing pandoc improves output quality

#### Scenario: PDF engine is configurable via the config file
- **WHEN** `[export] pdf_engine` is set in `config.toml` (e.g. `"pdfroff"`, `"tectonic"`)
- **THEN** the pandoc invocation for PDF export uses that engine instead of the default `xelatex`

#### Scenario: Full-fidelity text exports
- **WHEN** the user exports to styled HTML, plain HTML, LaTeX, or DOCX
- **THEN** the export preserves headings, lists, tables (with parsed alignment for LaTeX/HTML), code blocks, math fallback, and footnote/highlight/superscript constructs as each format allows

#### Scenario: PDF and DOCX fallback without pandoc
- **WHEN** the user exports to PDF or DOCX and the pandoc engine path fails (tool missing or conversion error)
- **THEN** the editor silently falls back to the built-in implementation and the export still succeeds

#### Scenario: Basic image snapshot export
- **WHEN** the user exports to PNG or JPEG
- **THEN** a basic text snapshot of the document is produced

#### Scenario: Output path is chosen by the user
- **WHEN** the user triggers an export
- **THEN** the editor prompts for a save location and suggests a filename derived from the current document

#### Scenario: Export failures are reported
- **WHEN** an export step fails
- **THEN** the editor shows a user-facing status message describing the failure

### Requirement: YAML front matter parsing and export metadata
The parser SHALL recognize a leading `---`-delimited YAML front matter block, parse key/value pairs, hide the block in the preview, and use recognized metadata (title, author, date) in the HTML export. The parser does not perform full YAML schema validation.

#### Scenario: Front matter is recognized and parsed
- **WHEN** the document begins with a `---`-delimited block
- **THEN** the parser extracts the key/value metadata and the preview hides the front matter block

#### Scenario: HTML export uses title, author, date
- **WHEN** the document is exported to HTML and the front matter contains title, author, or date
- **THEN** the HTML export incorporates that metadata into the rendered document

### Requirement: Native HTML/LaTeX export fidelity
The built-in HTML export SHALL keep inline and display math payloads byte-identical to the authored LaTeX (modulo HTML escaping) — extended inline syntax (superscript, subscript, emoji, autolink, highlight) SHALL NOT rewrite text inside math containers. The built-in LaTeX export SHALL preserve resolved inline styling (bold, italic, strikethrough, highlight, superscript, subscript, inline code, links), derive table column alignment from the Markdown separator row, render fenced code as `lstlisting` blocks (naming the language only when listings supports it), and place consecutive list items of the same kind in a single list environment with task-list checkboxes rendered as checkbox symbols.

#### Scenario: Inline math survives the superscript extension
- **WHEN** a paragraph contains `$a^2+b^2=c^2$` together with extended inline syntax such as `x^2^`
- **THEN** the exported HTML carries `data-latex="a^2+b^2=c^2"` unmodified while `x^2^` still renders as `<sup>2</sup>`

#### Scenario: LaTeX preserves inline styles
- **WHEN** a paragraph with bold, strikethrough, highlight, superscript, and link spans is exported to LaTeX
- **THEN** the output uses `\textbf`, `\sout`, `\hl`, `\textsuperscript`, and `\href` rather than flattening to plain text

#### Scenario: LaTeX table alignment follows the separator row
- **WHEN** a table declares `|:--|:-:|--:|`
- **THEN** the LaTeX `longtable` column spec is `{lcr}`

#### Scenario: Task list renders as one environment with checkboxes
- **WHEN** consecutive task-list items are exported to LaTeX
- **THEN** they share a single `itemize` environment and render `$\boxtimes$`/`$\square$` markers
